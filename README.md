# Hello there

### What do I do?

I'm a Software Engineer working for Capgemini in their Financial Services division, which basically means I get contracted out by them to work with Financial institutions in the US. 
Day-to-day I mostly work with AWS, C#, ASP.NET, .NET Framework, .NET Core, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular. 
However I absolutely love Python, Java, JavaScript, and C++ for my own personal projects and you will probably see me use those in most of my repos. 
If you want to keep up with what I'm doing, [just give a follow](https://github.com/users/follow?target=CorruptComputer)!
