# Hello there

### What do I do?

I'm a Software Engineer working for [Irth](https://www.irth.com). Day-to-day I mostly work with C# and ASP.NET, however I also use Python, Java, JavaScript, and C++ for some of my own personal projects. If you want to keep up with what I'm doing giving a follow on GitHub is probably the best way, I don't do much in terms of social media.

### Ways to get in touch
- Email: nickolas@gupton.xyz (probably the fastest and most reliable way to contact me, I'd like to keep this direct line to myself open but if it gets abused I will just remove it)
- LinkedIn: [Nickolas Gupton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickolasgupton/) (I don't check this very often, but I'll probably see it eventually)
- Discord: @corruptcomputer (if we have no servers in common you'll need to send me a friend request before discord will let you message me, sadly there is no option to change this)
- GitHub: If its regarding a repo of mine, you can just open an issue there, otherwise you can contact me about whatever you want [here](https://github.com/CorruptComputer/CorruptComputer/issues).
