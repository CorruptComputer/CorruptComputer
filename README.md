# Hello there

### What do I do?

I'm a Software Engineer working for [Irth](https://www.irth.com). Day-to-day I mostly work with C# and ASP.NET, however I also use Python, Java, JavaScript, and C++ for some of my own personal projects. If you want to keep up with what I'm doing, [just give a follow](https://github.com/users/follow?target=CorruptComputer)!
